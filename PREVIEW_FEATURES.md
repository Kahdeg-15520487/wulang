## Overview
The preview panel provides real-time analysis and feedback for spell circle construction, helping users optimize their magical compositions.

## Preview Panel Sections

### 1. Circle Information
- **Radius**: Current circle size
- **Talismans**: Current vs maximum talisman count
- **Type**: Composition type (Simple, Stacked, Network, Unified, etc.)

### 2. Power Analysis
- **Base Power**: Raw power output from talismans
- **Complexity**: Complexity score affecting casting difficulty
- **Final Output**: Power after composition bonuses/penalties
- **Casting Time**: Time required to cast the spell

### 3. Element Balance
- Visual breakdown of elemental distribution
- Shows primary and secondary element counts
- Color-coded by element type

### 4. Active Effects
- Current spell effects and their power levels
- Composition bonuses (if applicable)
- Real-time effect calculations

### 5. Composition Details
- Details about circle composition approach
- Nested circle count (for stacked compositions)
- Connection count (for network compositions)
- Mixed composition information (for unified approaches)

### 6. Performance Metrics
- **Efficiency**: Circle utilization percentage
- **Stability**: Casting reliability (High/Medium/Low/Critical)
- **Risk Level**: Overall risk assessment (Low/Medium/High)

### 7. Preview Actions
- **Simulate Casting**: Run a simulation with success probability
- **Export Analysis**: Save detailed analysis to text file
- **Generate Recommendations**: Get optimization suggestions

## Real-time Updates
The preview panel automatically updates when:
- Adding or removing talismans
- Changing circle size
- Loading existing configurations
- Generating demo circles

## Risk Assessment
The system evaluates risk based on:
- Complexity score (higher = more risky)
- Stability rating (lower = more risky)
- Element balance
- Circle utilization

## Optimization Recommendations
The system provides suggestions for:
- Improving element balance
- Increasing circle utilization
- Reducing complexity
- Enhancing stability

## Usage Tips
1. Monitor the stability rating while building circles
2. Use the efficiency metric to optimize talisman placement
3. Check recommendations for guidance on improvements
4. Export analysis for documentation and sharing
5. Simulate casting to verify expected outcomes
